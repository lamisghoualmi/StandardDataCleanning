# Standard Data Cleanning
This file containd my basic data cleaning for all kind of data set. The data cleanning process include the following steps:

##### -Check columns names
##### -Data Types for all variables 
##### -clean variables names (remove space, correcte misspelling)
##### -Removing duplicated samples
##### -Check percentage of missing values for each variable
##### -Removing variables with more than Threshold of missing values (Threshold is predefined depending on the data)
##### -Remove features with low variance
-Based on the idea that features with low variance add little to no information for distinguishing individual samples and, therefore, are irrelevant

##### -Get the ordinale variables from the dataset
-check  for missfield and spelling error and correct them

##### -Get the numeric data
 -Get the statistical description of the numeric variables in order to identify the suspected variables with outliers
 -Plot each suspected variables  to get a threshold and remove outliers
